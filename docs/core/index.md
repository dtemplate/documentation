# Core Docs

Oops, unfortunately the core documentation is not ready yet, but you can use [our CLI](/docs/cli) normally, and core itself too, but if you want to help us, write the documentation yourself! just take a look at [core code](https://github.com/dtemplate/dt/tree/master/core) and [contribution documentation](/docs/contribution)
